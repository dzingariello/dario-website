As a young professional, I've always been on the lookout for tools that can help me stay organized, productive, and on top of my game. For a long time, I relied on Notion to manage my tasks, notes, and projects. But recently, I've started to migrate many of my notes to Obsidian, and I haven't looked back yet.

One of the main reasons I switched to Obsidian is its focus on creating a network of interconnected notes. With Obsidian, you can easily create links between your notes using simple syntax, allowing you to quickly and easily create a personal knowledge base that can be used for a wide range of purposes. This has been a game-changer for me, as it allows me to quickly and easily explore and develop my ideas, and to create a flexible and powerful system for organizing my thoughts and information. This is especially helpful if you are working in IT or an IT-adjacent field, since you can save code snippets, cheat sheets, and other tips and tricks you learn along the way and interconnect them.

In contrast, Notion is a more versatile and flexible tool, with a wide range of features and tools for productivity and collaboration. While this can be useful in certain situations, I found that it often felt overwhelming and cluttered, with too many options and too little focus. Additionally, Notion's proprietary formatting can be a hindrance, whereas Obsidian uses the widely spread Markdown syntax.

Another advantage of Obsidian over Notion is its simplicity and ease of use. With Obsidian, you can create, link, and organize your notes using a simple and intuitive interface, without the need for complex formatting or customization. This has been a huge benefit for me, as it allows me to focus on my ideas and thoughts, rather than on the technical details of managing my notes.

Overall, I'm really happy with my switch to Obsidian. It's a powerful, focused, and intuitive tool that has revolutionized the way I manage my notes and ideas. Even tough I will still be using Notion for some things, I really like Obsidian and we will have to see, if over time Notion will fully fade into oblivion. If you are like me and are looking for a tool that can help you stay organized and on top of your game, I highly recommend giving Obsidian a try.
